# This is the decoupled implementation of OkayPlan, Environment, and main

## Dependencies:

```bash
torch >= 2.1.1
pygame >= 2.5.2
numpy >= 1.26.2

python >= 3.11.5
```
You can install **torch** by following the guidance from its [official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). We strongly suggest you install the **CUDA 12.1** version, though CPU version or lower CUDA version are also supported.

<br>

## How to use:
After installation, you can run OkayPlan via:
```bash
python main.py
```
Then you will see:
<div align="center">
<img width="25%" height="auto" src="https://github.com/XinJingHao/Images/blob/main/OkayPlan/navigation.gif">
</div>
where the red point is our robot, the green point is the target, and the blue curve is the path generated by OkayPlan. 

You can control the target point with your **Keyboard** (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT) 


### Basic parameters:

There are 6 main parameters that could be configured when running OkayPlan:

- **dvc (string; default `'dvc'`)**:
  
  - The device that runs the OkayPlan
    
  - Should be one of `'cpu'`/`'cuda'`. We suggest using `'cuda'` (GPU) to accelerate the simulation
 
- **RO (bool; default `'True'`)**:
  
  - True = random obstacles; False = consistent obstacles

- **DPI (bool; default `'True'`)**:
  
  - True = Dynamic Prioritized Initialization; False = Prioritized Initialization

- **KP (bool; default `'True'`)**:
  
  - True = Use Kinematics Penalty; False = Not use Kinematics Penalty

- **FPS (int; default `'0'`)**:
  
  - The FPS when rendering
  - **'0'** means render at the maximum speed
 
- **Playmode (bool; default `'False'`)**:
  
  - True = Control the target point with your keyboard (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT); False = Target point moves by itself

## History:
- 2024/3/14
  - Add support for obstacles with different number of segments
  - Add ```std_Trsd``` for ```Planner.py```, which balance between real-time performance and planning quality
